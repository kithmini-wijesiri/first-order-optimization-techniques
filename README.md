Gradient descent and Newton's method are two commonly used optimization algorithms in machine learning and computational chemistry. Both methods seek to find the minimum of a function, which is often a cost function that measures the discrepancy between model predictions and observed data


Gradient descent is a first-order optimization method that uses the gradient of the function to update the parameters iteratively. The gradient is a vector of the partial derivatives of the function with respect to each parameter. The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the parameters and takes small steps in the direction of the negative gradient, which corresponds to the direction of steepest descent. The step size is controlled by a learning rate hyperparameter, which determines the size of the update at each iteration. If the learning rate is too large, the algorithm may overshoot the minimum and diverge, while if it is too small, the algorithm may converge slowly. The gradient descent algorithm terminates when the change in the function value is below a predefined threshold or after a maximum number of iterations.

Newton's method is a second-order optimization method that uses the gradient and the Hessian matrix of the function to update the parameters. The Hessian is a matrix of the second partial derivatives of the function with respect to each pair of parameters. The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the parameters and computes the inverse of the Hessian matrix, which corresponds to the curvature of the function. The step size is then determined by multiplying the gradient by the inverse of the Hessian, which gives the direction of the minimum curvature. Newton's method typically converges faster than gradient descent, but it requires the computation of the Hessian matrix, which can be computationally expensive for large datasets.
